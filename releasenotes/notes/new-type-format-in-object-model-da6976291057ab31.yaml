features:
  - Changed the type representation in the object model. Previously there were
    three attributes in the "?" section of the object - ``type``, ``classVersion``,
    and ``package``, where only the ``type`` was mandatory. Now, these attributes are merged into
    single attribute ``type`` that has the ``typeName/version@package`` format.
    Tthe ``version`` and ``package`` parts are still optional.
upgrades:
  - Any tools that inspected the object model should be updated to expect
    new object format representation ``typeName/version@package``

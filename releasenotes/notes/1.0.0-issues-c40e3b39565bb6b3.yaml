issues:
  - Murano services will not operate correctly when installed on a separate detached node, if you're installing
    ``fuel-plugin-murano`` in an environment that contains Murano, bundled with Fuel 9.0. This happens because
    ``murano-engine`` service on controller nodes is still active. As a workaround, you need to disable ``murano-engine``
    service on controller nodes manually after installing ``fuel-plugin-murano``.
  - Deploying Cloud Foundry integration service with this release of ``fuel-plugin-murano`` does not work correctly.

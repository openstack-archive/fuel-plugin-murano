features:
  - Added support for application deployment across OpenStack regions.
    Now, all OpenStack resource classes inherit from ``io.murano.CloudResource``
    that provides ``.getRegion()`` method and ``regionName`` property.
    This allows assigning resources
    to different regions. ``.getRegion()`` returns ``io.murano.CloudRegion``
    instance that resource or its parent belongs to.
    The interface of ``CloudRegion`` is similar to the ``Environment`` class and should be used to
    get ``HeatStack`` instance associated with the region,
    default network configuration, security
    group manager, and agent listener instances. ``Environment`` now acts as
    a default region so backward compatibility is not broken. However, new
    applications should not use the ``Environment`` to set security group rules but
    rather a region(s) of their instance(s) in order to work correctly when
    their instances were configured to use region other than the default.

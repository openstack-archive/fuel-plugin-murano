features:
  - Implemented the capability for API endpoint ``/catalog/packages``
    to filter 'id', 'category', 'tag' properties using the 'in' operator.
    An example of using the 'in' operator for 'id' is
    'id=in:id1,id2,id3'.
    Added this filter using the syntax that conforms to the latest
    guidelines from the OpenStack API-WG.

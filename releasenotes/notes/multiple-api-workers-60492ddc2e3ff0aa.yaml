features:
  - Added the ``api_workers`` option to the ``murano`` configuration group. It controls
    the number of API workers launched by murano-api. If not set, it defaults to
    the number of CPUs available.

deprecations:
  - Renamed the ``workers`` option from the ``engine`` group
    to ``engine_workers`` to reduce ambiguity with the ``api_workers`` option.
